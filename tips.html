                        <p>Many succulents produce baby plants (pups) around the mother plant.  To grow plants from these pups, pull the soil back from the plant to cut the pup off where it joins the mother plant. Leave the pup exposed to the air for a couple of days so that the bottom develops a callus... </p>

Keep them evenly moist by watering from the bottom.  Watering from the top could result in the crown rotting.  Feed with a 15-30-15 or similar plant food once every...</p>

They prefer to be situated in a place where they receive indirect for at least 6 hours a day.  Water when the soil feels dry to the...</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Top Dressing Large Houseplants</li>
                        <p>Houseplants that are too large to transplant will greatly benefit from a top-dressing of compost. Remove 2 cm of existing soil or compost and add some fresh compost.</p>
                        <li>Call an arborist</li>
                        <p>Winter is the right time to have a diseased or dangerous tree removed. Arborists are less busy at this time of year and there is no foliage to obscure their view. They will perform their work on a day when the weather is calm and the tree is not covered in ice.</p>
                        <li>Check on stored bulbs, rhizomes and tubers</li>
                        <p>Once a month throughout the winter, check to make sure that your stored dahlias, cannas and the like are not rotting or drying out.</p>
                        <li>Plan ahead</li>
                        <p>January is the perfect month to review your garden catalogues and consider what you want to grow this spring. Place your seed order as some plants need to be started indoors many weeks before their outdoor planting date.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Preparing For Winter Winds</li>
                        <p>Take a walk around your garden with your saw or loppers, removing damaged or hanging branches that might cause further damage to your trees when battered by winter winds.</p>
                        <li>Diseased Leaves</li>
                        <p>Diseased leaves should be removed from under trees and shrubs.  Do not put them in your compost pile.</p>
                        <li>Tie In Long Rose Canes</li>
                        <p>Tie down climbing rose canes to protect them from cold winds. If you tie the flexible canes roses in a horizontal arc along a fence or trellis, it will trigger the greater bud break leading to more blossoms next year.</p>
                        <li>Watering Trees and Shrubs</li>
                        <p>Trees and shrubs need to be watered until the soil freezes. This is especially important in seasons where the amount of rainfall has been less than optimal.</p>
